# Ex5 - Pepse game 

This game, developed using OOP principles, is an endless, side-scrolling platformer reminiscent of classic Super Mario.  
It features a pixel-art world with dynamic elements like mountains, trees with falling and regenerating leaves, and randomly jumping foxes.  
The player controls an avatar capable of walking, jumping, and limited-time flying before returning to the ground.  
The game's environment is enriched with a day-night cycle, represented by the sun completing full rotations, adding a vivid and immersive aspect to the gameplay.

## How to move the avatar
press → to move right  
press ← to move left  
press 'space' to jump  
press 'space' + 'shift' to fly. drop shift to stop. (note that the avatar will fly for a limit amount of time)
